A simple PD machine that i built, implementing OSC for the sound parameter controling.

The machine is working but there's some PD extensions that you need to install first for making it works, these extensions are:
1. pd-mrpeach
2. freeverb~
3. pd-pan

There's a little bit of issues on the PD log. If you happen to could fix this issue, please make a commit.

Thank you,
Rangga
